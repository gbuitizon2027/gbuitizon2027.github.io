      Hogwarts is indeed known as the most prestigious school focusing on magic. Yet despite the recognition, we also value the importance of our students being well rounded in the field of science and technology in order to spark innovative and creative minds within the student body. The digestive system is an integral part of our daily routine. Whether it be morning, noon, or nighttime, this system works to get all the nutrients it can get from the food you ingest. The simulation activity conducted shows a visualization of the different actions that are happening on your food.

          Q1 - What is being simulated by putting bananas and crackers in the zip lock?<br>

          Q5 - What is being simulated by the addition of orange juice?<br>
          Q6 - What do you think are the possible biomolecule components of the food inside?
        </h5>
        <p class="">
          The first part of this interactive simulaton is to put the bananas and crackers into the zip-locked bag. The zip-locked bag acts as the container for the bananas and crackers and represents the stomach. The action of putting the food into the bag represents the first step to food ingestion, representing the food entering the oral cavity and traveling down through to the stomach.
        </p>

        <p class="">
          The next step was to add water into the mix, which represents the liquid secreted inside the oral cavity, more commonly known as saliva. The amylase inside the liquid helps break down the food as it gets chewed. It specifically targets the large starch macromolecules and converts them into simple sugar molecules.
        </p>

        <p class="">
          Afterwards, we proceed to crushing the contents of the zip lock bag. Crushing the food mimics the way our stomach contracts in order to digest the bolus delivered from the esophagus. We added orange juice into the bag&mdash;orange juice, a citrus drink, simulates the secretion of digestive enzymes (pepsin) in the stomach. 
        </p>

        <p class="">
          Almost everything we eat is made up of biomolecules. Some components of the crackers and banana are lipids and carbohydrates.

              Questions to be answered:<br>
              Q7 - What is being simulated by the liquid flowing out of the stocking?<br>
              Q8 - What does the tray represent?<br>
              Q9 - What is left inside the stocking?<br>
              Q10 - What is being simulated by pushing the partially solidified content?
            </h5>
            <p class="">
              In the transfer stage, we moved the contents from the zip-locked bag to a plastic cup, the mixture going inside the stocking. The liquid that was filtered out of the stocking simulated the absorption of nutrients in the small intestine. The tray, we believe, is the intestinal lumen, for it absorbs the water and nutrients from the food. What remained inside the stocking were the “undigested materials” that were drained of its nutritional contents, which is the feces.
            </p>
  
            <p class="">
              We then had to push the content out of the cup. Pushing our partially solidified content simulates peristalsis which is the involuntary contraction and relaxation of the intestine that, in turn, creates wave-like movements that push the matter further. This is part of the last stage of food processiing, called elimination.

          Q12 - In which organ of the digestive system can you compare the paper towels? How does the structure of the organ help in its function?
        </h5>
        <p class="mb-4">
          In this section, we used paper towels to simulate absorption. The paper towel with four folds absorbed the most water due to the increased surface area provided by the folds. We can compare the paper towels to the small intestine. Its structure largely contributes to its ability to absorb water and nutrients. It does so by highly folding its internal lining which forms microscopic finger-like projections called villi which increases the surface area to help with absorption.

          Questions to be answered:<br>
          Q13 - Explain the role of bile in digestion. Is it involved in chemical or mechanical digestion?
        </h5>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Lastly, we simulated bile action through dishwashing liquid and oil. Despite being a liquid, bile is not a digestive enzyme, rather an emulsifier. It helps break down fats into fatty acids. It is only involved in mechanical digestion. We observed that the jar with the dishwashing liquid got foamy and cloudy with air bubbles on the surface, while the jar without it was relatively clear. The dishwashing liquid is supposed to represent the bile.

    <h2 class="intro-title text-center">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 intro-paragraph">
      With this activity, we were given the opportunity to explore the different stages of the digestive system, from ingestion all the way to elimination. During the first stage of the experiment, we started with ingestion, and moved on to digestion. We successfully broke down the food into smaller parts while in the zip-lock bag during the crushing stage and were able to move onto the transfer stage, using a stocking and a plastic cup to represent different parts of the digestive system. The simulation of absorption and simulation of bile action gave us a look on how the various stages work on the food, not just on an organ scale but even closer.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2 intro-paragraph">
      The simulation conducted has given us a greater understanding of the system that gives us the very nutrients that we need in order to survive. The complex processes happening onto the food that we eat were shown to us step by step, giving us a visualization of each part. One of the real-world applications of this is that we will be able to more accurately pinpoint the source of our digestive problems whenever we feel something wrong. It may also be helpful when it comes to deciding what type of food to eat, especially when we've been diagnosed with certain organ problems, now that we know which organ contributes to the breakdown of which kind of food.
