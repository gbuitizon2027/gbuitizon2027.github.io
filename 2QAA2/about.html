        <h2 class="title text-center">Early History</h2>
        <p class="text">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry was founded around 990 A.D. by four of the greatest wizards and witches of the age: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. They each represented an aspect of personality that they wanted to bring out in new students.</p>
        <p class="text">The first student class to graduate from the school were immortalised in a portrait that would continue to hang in the school for over 1000 years.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <h2 class="title text-center">Middle History</h2>
        <p class="text">The school had historically shouldered the responsibility of protecting "dangerous things" from falling into the wrong hands, and carrying the burden of the job remarkably well despite the fact that subsequent heads of the school and members of the faculty came to recognise how it compromised the security of the castle.</p>
        <p class="text">About three hundred years after the school was founded, the Triwizard Tournament was established as an interscholastic competition between three of the most prestigious magical schools in Europe: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang.</p>
